> [!NOTE]
> The evaluation code in this repo is forked from [SWE-bench/SWE-bench](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-bench), with only minimal modifications to support evaluation on the SWE-bench-Live dataset. All other settings remain consistent with SWE-bench to reduce the migration effort. For code part, please respect the original [license](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-bench/blob/main/LICENSE) from the SWE-bench repository.

SWE-bench-Live is a live benchmark for issue resolving, designed to evaluate an AI system's ability to complete real-world software engineering tasks. Thanks to our automated dataset curation pipeline, we plan to update SWE-bench-Live on a monthly basis to provide the community with up-to-date task instances and support rigorous and contamination-free evaluation.

## News

- **06/30/2025**: We‚Äôve updated the dataset ‚Äî it now includes a total of **1,565** task instances across **164** repositories!
- **05/21/2025**: The initial release of SWE-bench-Live includes 1,319 latest (created after 2024) task instances, each paired with an instance-level Docker image for test execution, covering 93 repositories.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

## üöÄ Set Up

```bash
# Python >= 3.10
pip install -e .
```

Test your installation by running:
```bash
python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation \
    --dataset_name SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live \
    --split lite \
    --instance_ids amoffat__sh-744 \
    --namespace starryzhang \
    --predictions_path gold \
    --max_workers 1 \
    --run_id validate-gold
```

## üö• Evaluation

Evaluate your model on SWE-bench-Live.

```bash
python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation \
    --dataset_name SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live \
    --split <lite/full> \
    --namespace starryzhang \
    --predictions_path <path_to_your_preds or gold> \
    --max_workers <num_workers> \
    --run_id <run_id>
```

Instance-level Docker images are hosted on DockerHub.

## üê≥ Dataset Curation

In SWE-bench-Live, we propose an automated pipeline for curating SWE-bench-like dataset.

### RepoLaunch

We addresses the bottleneck of setting up execution environments by automating the process through an LLM-based agentic tool ‚Äì [RepoLaunch](./launch/README.md). It can deliver a testable containerized environment for any given GitHub repository, thereby enabling test-based evaluation in SWE-bench-Live. 

See [./launch](./launch/) folder for RepoLaunch code.

> [!NOTE]
> We provide a [tutorial](./curation/tutorial.md) to help you walk through the entire dataset curation process, starting from repository crawling.
